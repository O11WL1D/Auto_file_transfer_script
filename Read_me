These are some programs I wrote to automate the process of transfering my files from my laptop/computer to an external drive, 
They were orginally only meant to be used by myself but now that the importance of publically documenting my code has become revealed to me,
I've changed my mind. Typically my external volumes are preloaded with 4 files, documents, desktop, pictures and downloads, and said files
are set as the transfer location for the xcopy command in the program. when I run the machine cp(copy) command, everything on my machine 
is copyied to the external volumes and overwrites any pre-existing files. The machine del command then deletes everything found on the 
machines target folders. The volume transfer and delete programs work in an almost identical manner except for the fact that they are designed
to transfer files from one external volume to another, and delete files off of external volumes>
