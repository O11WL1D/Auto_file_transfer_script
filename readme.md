# intro

These are the hotkey shortcuts I have programmed on my computer, every program in the bat folder can be accessed by me
by opening the run shortcut, which is accessed via pressing the windows key and r simultaniously.

By editing the path variable on my computer to include this folder, I have told it where the programs I call via run
are located. 

I make each program to be three letters or less so that execution of my shortcuts are as fast as possible. 

Any automated process that you may see in other parts of my github, such as the default bash update, is produced by the 
programs located here. 

test. 



# general log


5/10/2023

now that I have finished up the semester and have a little time to myself, I think I'll try to get some work done on the 16 bit processor. 

unfortunately, I've come to find out that windows 11 has changed the default path from 

C:/users/dudkr/Pictures

to C:\Users\dudkr\OneDrive\Pictures\ctrl\bat

this sucks, this might mean that I need to make a windows 11 version for my bat commands.

THATS IT, Ive had enough of this terribly implemented set of programs!
It takes too long to set up these batch hotkeys for a new computer, 

im changing the programs to read an environmental variable uuser to read 
the current user instead of needing to change that anytime I need to setup on a 
new system with a different user value.

alright its all fixed now â˜º

This repository would be much easier to set up if I made the current user in each program an environmental variable
which I could just change in the environmental variables menu. This kinda sucks lol

I really want to create a program creation wizard, which automatically adds the description of what each bash program
does to the ww program, so that I dont have to go in manually every so often and add that description myself. Maybe even 
creating a setup wizard which auto appends the path for easy setup would be nice too.



-> it would also be nice to create a git u program creation wizard for different folders, such as for this one and what not.


-> or U could be a universal update, which executes each update program, I think that is a super easy way to execute that :)

-> for some strange reason, the u master update program will only work if the next update call is placed at the 
end of the previous update program call. I have no explaination for this, thanks microsoft. 


The end of the call list will be located in an echo comment in the u program. :)
