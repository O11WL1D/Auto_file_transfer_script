# intro

These are the hotkey shortcuts I have programmed on my computer, every program in the bat folder can be accessed by me
by opening the run shortcut, which is accessed via pressing the windows key and r simultaniously.

By editing the path variable on my computer to include this folder, I have told it where the programs I call via run
are located. 

I make each program to be three letters or less so that execution of my shortcuts are as fast as possible. 

Any automated process that you may see in other parts of my github, such as the default bash update, is produced by the 
programs located here. 

test. 



# general log

I really want to create a program creation wizard, which automatically adds the description of what each bash program
does to the ww program, so that I dont have to go in manually every so often and add that description myself. Maybe even 
creating a setup wizard which auto appends the path for easy setup would be nice too.



-> it would also be nice to create a git u program creation wizard for different folders, such as for this one and what not.


-> or U could be a universal update, which executes each update program, I think that is a super easy way to execute that :)

-> for some strange reason, the u master update program will only work if the next update call is placed at the 
end of the previous update program call. I have no explaination for this, thanks microsoft. 


The end of the call list will be located in an echo comment in the u program. :)
