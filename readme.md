# intro

These are the hotkey shortcuts I have programmed on my computer, every program in the bat folder can be accessed by me
by opening the run shortcut, which is accessed via pressing the windows key and r simultaniously.

By editing the path variable on my computer to include this folder, I have told it where the programs I call via run
are located. 

I make each program to be three letters or less so that execution of my shortcuts are as fast as possible. 

Any automated process that you may see in other parts of my github, such as the default bash update, is produced by the 
programs located here.
