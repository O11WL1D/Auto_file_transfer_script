c notes

!-- The %s conversion specifier only reads the first string up untill a null terminator. cannot deal with multiple strings. --!

!-----SUPER INPORTANT_____!!!
Whenever the user presses on the enter key, the ascii value 10 is generated, or aka \n character. 
This means you can check when the user has finished typing in input like an epic b0ss



-- %s in scanf --> 
Always stores a null character in addition to the recorded string, therefore when using %s with a call to the scanf function you
should have an array the size of the string+1 as the passed argument


The %x conversion specifier::
indicates that you want a value printed off in hexadecimal

usage   - %08x

0 - indicates you want to pad with zeros and not whitespace
8 - indicates number of spaces to left justify  -- minimum space to adjust for.



printf("fuck you%08x",vari);
